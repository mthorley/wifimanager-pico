# Purpose

HTML and related content included here is to support development of HTML web pages shown as part of the capture portal.
These pages are not deployed but converted into PROGMEM strings within `WiFiManagerAssets.h` and programtically updated in `WiFiManager.cpp`.

Icons are attributed to https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/.
